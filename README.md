# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping Earthquakes with JS &amp; APIs

## Overview: 
Using Leaflet.js API, a map was populated with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. 
Each earthquake with a magnitude greater than 4.5 is visually represented with a circle and color, and a larger magnitude will have a larger diameter circle. 
Each earthquake marker has a popup marker that displays the magnitude of the earthquake and the location. 
Users can choose to view the map in street view, satellite street view, and third additional view.
Users can also select from the layers: Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates, Major Earthquakes.
